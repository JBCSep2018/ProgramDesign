1. Create a basic application

Algorithm:
Input
-----
number

Process
-------
Prompt for an integer
Store the input in number1
Add 5 to number 1
Store it in number2
Multiply the number2 * 2
Store it in number3
Subtract 7 from number3
Store it in total
Print total

Output 
------
Print the total 	


Pseudocode:
DEFINE number1
DEFINE number2
DEFINE number3
DEFINE TOTAL
PROMPT "Enter an integer number"
INPUT number1
number2 = number1 + 5
number3 = number2 * 2
total = number3 - 7
PRINT total



2. Add three numbers and print the total

Algorithm:
Input
----- 
number 
counter

Processing 
---------
SET counter to 1
SET total to 0
WHILE counter less than 4
PROMPT for an integer 
STORE integer in number
ADD number to total and 
STORE it in total
ADD one to counter 
PRINT total 

Output 
------
Print the total

Pseudocode:
DEFINE number 
DEFINE total 
DECLARE counter
SET counter = 1
SET total = 0
	WHILE (counter < 4)
	PROMPT "Enter a number " + counter
	INPUT number
	total =  total + number
	counter = counter + 1
END WHILE
PRINT total


3. Find the average score

Algorithm:
Input
----- 
score 
counter
average 

Processing 
---------
SET counter to 1
SET total to 0
WHILE counter less than 11
PROMPT for score 
STORE input in score
ADD score to total and 
STORE it in total
ADD one to counter 
DIVIDE total by 10 and 
STORE it in average
PRINT average 

Output
Print average 

DEFINE score
DEFINE total
DEFINE average  
DECLARE counter
SET counter = 1
SET total = 0
WHILE(COUNTER<11)
	PROMPT "Enter test score"
	INPUT score 
	total = total + score
	counter = counter + 1
END WHILE
average = score / 10
PRINT average


4. How much water runs off the roof

Algorithm:
Input
-----
roofLengthFeet
roofWidthFeet
rainfallInches
roofLengthInches
roofWidthInches
rainfallCubic
rainfallGallon

Process
-------
Prompt user for length of roof in feet
Save input into roofLengthFeet
Prompt user for width of roof in feet
Save input to roofWidthFeet
Prompt user for inches of rainfall
Save input to rainfallInches
Convert roofLengthFeet to inches by multiplying it by 12
Store the converted value in roofLengthInches
Convert roofWidthFeet to inches my multiplying by 12
Store the converted value in roofWidthInches
Multiply roofLengthInches by roofWidthInches and rainfallInches to get total rainfall
Store total rainfall in rainfallCubic
Divide rainfallCubic by 231 to get value of rainfall in gallons
Store it in rainfallGallon
Print rainfallGallon

Output
------
rainfallGallon

Pseudocode:
DEFINE roofLengthFeet
DEFINE roofWidthFeet
DEFINE rainfallInches
DEFINE roofLengthInches
DEFINE roofWidthInches
DEFINE totalRainfall
DEFINE rainFallInGallon

PROMPT "Enter roof length in feet"
INPUT roofLengthFeet
PROMPT "Enter roof width in feet"
INPUT roofWidthFeet
PROMPT "Enter rainfall in inches"
INPUT rainfallInches
Convert roofLengthFeet to inches
roofLengthInches = roofLengthFeet * 12
Convert roofWidthFeet to inches
roofWidthInches = roofWidthFeet * 12
totalRainfall = roofLengthInches * roofWidthInches * rainfallInches
rainFallInGallon = totalRainfall / 231
